### Fine-Tuning Detection Rules



# Key Takeaways

### Lessons Learned:
- **Hands-on Experience**: Working with LimaCharlie provided me with a deeper understanding of detection engineering.
- **Rule Crafting**: Creating accurate and efficient detection rules requires testing and fine-tuning.
- **Real-Time Defense**: Setting up auto-blocking for attacks provides a proactive approach to threat management.
- **YARA Integration**: Using YARA rules adds another layer of detection for file-based threats.
